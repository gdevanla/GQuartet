This project was built as a protptype for a coding contest. The code was hacked together and does not follow any good coding practices. Even hard-coded values are littered around the project. Clean up is one o the big TODO items on the list come this summer!


Some Notes:

git remote add origin git@github.com:gdevanla/GQuartet.git
git push -u origin master
